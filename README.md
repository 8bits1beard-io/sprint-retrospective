## Customization

### Branding

Edit the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
colors: {
  'walmart-blue': '#0071ce',
  'walmart-yellow': '#ffc220',
  'walmart-dark': '#004c91',
  'walmart-light': '#e6f2ff',
}
```

### Column Configuration

Modify the column setup in `src/utils.ts`:

```javascript
const configs = {
  liked: {
    title: 'Liked',
    subtitle: 'What went well',
    icon: 'üëç',
    // ... styling
  },
  // Add or modify columns here
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized re-rendering with React.memo
- Debounced Firebase updates
- Maximum 50 notes per column limit
- Client-side rate limiting
- Local storage backup for connection issues

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Troubleshooting

### Local Storage Issues
- Check browser settings allow local storage
- Verify browser is not in private/incognito mode
- Clear browser cache if data appears corrupted

### Build Errors
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Ensure Node.js version is 14 or higher
- Check for conflicting global packages

### Cross-tab Sync Not Working
- Ensure tabs are in the same browser
- Check that local storage is enabled
- Refresh the tab if sync appears stuck
